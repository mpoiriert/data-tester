Asserts
=======

The list of asserts available are a sub-set of the **PHPUnit\\Framework\\Assert** available.

Some of the methods have been remove since they are replicable trough a combination of **path** and another assert.
Other are not available either for compatibility issues. If you think that some must be added just open a issue
in the git repository.
